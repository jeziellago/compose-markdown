} 
...
```

        implementation 'com.github.jeziellago:compose-markdown:{LAST-RELEASE}'

```

# Supported attributes

Most of the attributes of that a default `Text` composable has are also supported by `MarkdownText`.

The font can be changed by passing a font xml resource as `fontResource` parameter.

```kotlin  
val markdownContent = """  
	# Sample  
	* Markdown  
	* [Link](https://example.com)  
	![Image](https://example.com/img.png)  
	<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>  
"""

//Minimal example
@Composable  
fun MinimalExampleContent() {  
    MarkdownText(markdown = markdownContent)  
} 

//Complex example
@Composable  
fun ComplexExampleContent() {  
     MarkdownText(
                modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp),
                markdown = markdown,
                maxLines = 3,
                fontResource = R.font.montserrat_medium,
                style = TextStyle(
                        color = Color.Blue,
                        fontSize = 12.sp,
                        lineHeight = 10.sp,
                        textAlign = TextAlign.Justify,
                 ),
