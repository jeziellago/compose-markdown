## Setup
1. Open the file `settings.gradle` (it looks like that)
```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        // add jitpack here üëáüèΩ
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
       ...
    }
} 
...
```
2. Sync the project
3. Add `compose-markdown` dependency
```groovy
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.jeziellago:compose-markdown:0.3.1'
}
```

# Supported attributes

Most of the attributes of that a default `Text` composable has are also supported by `MarkdownText`. 

- color 
- fontSize
- textAlign
- maxLines
- style (only styling for supported attributes is applied)

The font can be changed by passing a font xml resource as `fontResource` parameter. 

## How to use
```kotlin  
val markdown = """  
	# Sample  
	* Markdown  
	* [Link](https://example.com)  
	![Image](https://example.com/img.png)  
	<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>  
"""

//Minimal example
@Composable  
fun MinimalExampleContent() {  
    MarkdownText(markdown = markdownContent)  
} 

//Complex example
@Composable  
fun ComplexExampleContent() {  
     MarkdownText(
                modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp),
                markdown = markdown,
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
                fontSize = 12.sp,
                color = LocalContentColor.current,
                maxLines = 3,
                fontResource = R.font.montserrat_medium,
                style = MaterialTheme.typography.overline,
              
     )
